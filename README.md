Only download the bundled configs, unless you know how to import separate files then feel free to download the seperate ones

# Steps to load these configs 

1. Open up repetier (I use V1.0.6) 

2. Click on the Slicer tab 

3. Click load config bundle

4. Browse to your downloads (or wherever you saved the files) 

5. Click on the config bundle 

6. Hit ok 

7. Enjoy your printing! 


*I have not yet perfectly calibrated my settings and there are some issues with extrusion multipliers and first layer width, so feel free to mess around with them*
